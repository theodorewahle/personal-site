# Hot Button: Twitter Search

Hot Button is a new way to search Twitter. Hot Button scans news headlines to identify hot topics, and then allows you to sort a user's tweets by their relevancy to recent news. Hot Button's comparisons between hot topics and a user's tweets are powered by scikit-learn!
