The best advice I’ve ever received was from my neighbor. He’s an old man with white hair and a coffee-stained grey cardigan. He always shares his wisdom, and he speaks like he’s falling asleep. He’s like if Yoda lived in Massachusetts. “Everything compounds,” he told me. At the time, I didn’t know it was good advice. “What is compounds?” I replied.

Compounding is a term that comes from investing. Imagine you invest $1000 in a stock that grows at 10% per year and you reinvest the profits after each year. After a year, you’ll have $1100. After two years, $1210. After three, $1330. And after 50 years, you’ll have $117,390. You started at $1000 and now you have $117, 390. That’s compounding. When you reinvest your profits back into the same stock year-after-year, you get the big payoff.
My neighbor told me that compounding doesn’t only work for money or stocks. It also works for knowledge, success, and relationships. In these cases, you’re not investing money, but you’re investing time.

Knowledge compounds. Instead of focusing on one stock, compound knowledge comes from focusing on one topic. If I want to be ultra-knowledgeable about computers, I need to focus on studying computers. Each new book strengthens insights from previous books. The book I’m reading about coding in C++ helps me understand what I read last year about operating systems. Now, the value of the time I invested in reading the old book is worth 10% more. This works because I’m investing in a single topic. It’s fine if I want to mix in the occasional book about History or Spanish. But those are not going to increase the value of what I’ve already learned about computers.

Success compounds too. Going from 0 to 1,000 followers on Twitter is way harder than going from 1,000 to 2,000. Once you have 1,000 followers, your tweets reach more people than back when you only had a few dozen followers. This works offline too. If you’re an actress, you might take some obscure independent roles to get your career rolling. If 1000 people see your first movie, they will tell their friends. Then, you get cast in a bigger movie and 1200 people see it. Pretty soon, you are Meryl Streep.

All types of compounding – money, knowledge, success – they all make sense. But the one that fascinates me is relationships. Friendships, professional relationships, and romantic relationships all compound. In other words, each new year you spend with someone makes the previous years feel more fulfilling and meaningful. This is intuitive. It’s why we’re way more impressed by a couple’s 50th anniversary than their first anniversary. After 50 years, that couple has cultivated something extremely meaningful.

The most fulfilling friendships are lifelong. There’s a deep comfort in spending time with someone as an adult who has known you since you were in diapers. So my neighbor says to only invest time in relationships that could be lifelong. Similarly, there's a famous entrepreneur named Naval Ravikant. He says, “If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day.” That’s directionally correct but too harsh. People aren’t stocks. Sometimes, you are friends with someone just during saxophone camp. You have one magical summer, and then you never see them again. That’s okay. Cultivating relationships that “compound” is more of a guideline than a hard-and-fast rule. It’s the plastic bumper than will prevent your social life from rolling into the gutter. Every relationship is an investment. My time is valuable, and it makes sense to invest it into people that bring me outsized joy in the the long run.
