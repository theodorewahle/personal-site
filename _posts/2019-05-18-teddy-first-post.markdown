1. **Eliminate Database Migrations** - I don't think we need database migrations. I don't know enough about database theory to know how to fix them, but they seem like a huge pain-point for everyone. I think you could build a product that cleanly abstracts them.

2. **Heroku + Firebase for Machine Learning** - Figure out the "80/20" of Machine Learning. (The most common patterns that most widely-used models fall into.) Then, I think you could make some kind of platform wherein you dump a bunch of data and can turn it into some kind of ML model.

3. **Book Difficulty Assessment** - There is something called Fleschâ€“Kincaid Readability Test. It is basically an algorithm that tells you the grade-level of a body of text. I would like to build a database of the grade-level of every book in the world. Then, I could avoid buying books that use too many fancy words for the sake of sounding smart.

4. **Stackshare Based VC Fund** - Stackshare.io is this website that shows the stacks of every tech company. If I were a start-up investor, I would somehow figure out a way to detect exceptional rates of user adoption, as measured by companies declaring on Stackshare that they use a technology. I would then invest in the most promising technologies.
